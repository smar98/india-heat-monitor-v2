"""
Heat-metric functions for the India Humid Heat Monitor.

Keeps three metrics strictly separate, per this project's editorial rule:
  1. Dry-bulb temperature -- the raw value from Open-Meteo, used as-is.
  2. Wet-bulb temperature -- Stull (2011) empirical approximation.
  3. Estimated WBGT -- Liljegren et al. (2008) model (see liljegren_wbgt.py),
     with NIOSH RAL/REL exposure limits (not fixed "safe/unsafe" bands) as
     the risk reference.

Never compare wet-bulb values against WBGT thresholds, and vice versa --
they are different physical quantities with different risk meanings.

# it produces WBGT values off by several tenths of a degree C at midday.
