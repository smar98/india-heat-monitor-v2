"""
Data sanity gate for heat/data/latest.json. Run after fetch_forecast.py and
BEFORE committing the result -- in GitHub Actions this failing means the
workflow fails and the previous (valid) data stays live, rather than a
corrupt file silently replacing it.

Checks, per the project's "a data gap must never masquerade as no risk"
rule:
  - file parses, was generated recently (not a stale re-commit)
  - every city in cities.json is present exactly once, with >= 24 hours
  - hourly timestamps are contiguous (no silent gaps) in IST
  - every value sits inside a physically plausible range
  - wet-bulb never exceeds dry-bulb beyond Stull's documented error bound
  - wbgt_c is null exactly when the solver reported failure (status != 0)
  - the stored WBGT equals the ISO 7243 combination of its own stored
    components (0.7*Tnwb + 0.2*Tglobe + 0.1*Tair) -- an internal
    consistency check that would catch a pipeline mix-up between columns
  - solver failures are rare (<5% of city-hours)

Exits non-zero with a readable message on the first hard failure.
